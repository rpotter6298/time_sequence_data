axes reversed? Speck formation on ATP should be the lower numbers -done
Also start the axes at 1 on both sides - done


With ArbMax calcs, also do realmax (C1, D1, etc)

Cyto:
	Is max different than start - added to summary as Max Measurement P-Value
	If yes, what time did it become significant? - created time point comparisons report
	
	Figure out at what times there is a difference in ratio between treatments
	

Replace bootstrap with a library-based thing instead of your own shit - done

	
++ Summary Table is the p-value which compares the difference between the set of numbers that are time 0 with the set of numbers which correspond to the maximum value for EACH replicate. 
In other words "Are the peaks significantly different from the start"
Conversely, significant times table evaluates this on a strictly per-time bases so the curves are not aligned between replicates (especially ATP).
This is more of a "At any given time can we confirm significant changes"
These give different answers, so it took me a while to figure out why that was.
